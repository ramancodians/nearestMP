## Introduction


The information is the most powerful tool we have in this digital era. But then it comes to information about the politicians we still have to dig through hundreds of pdf documents on Election Commission's website to just to find information about the candidate.

There's simply not a tool currently which can make this process simple.
THE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE ACT, 1950, makes it compulsory for all
the candidates to disclose their financial, criminal and personal records. Those records are shared with Election Commission of India and not index.

After the election, Lok Sabha and State Assemblies maintain records of MLA/MP attendance participation and other information. All the information is segregated and hard to connect together to understand the overall performance of a politician.

Neta Watch aims to solve this problem, by creating an easy to use platform where the voter can see all the information they need before the election and after it. Facts and data like these will help the voter to make a sound decision.
Think of it as Zomato for politicians. Where people can rank and rate their politicians for their actions and background.
